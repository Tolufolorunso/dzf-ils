- Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### 3. **Automatic Photo Cropping**

- Maintains image quality with 80% JPEG compression

### 4. **Enhanced Avatar Display**

## Testing Instructions

### Desktop Testing:

1. Navigate to any patron detail page (e.g., `/patrons/20230001`)
2. Click **"üì∑ Take Photo"** - should request camera permission
3. Click **"üìÅ Choose File"** - should open file picker
4. Test cropping by uploading a non-square image

### Mobile Testing:

1. Open the app on mobile device
2. Navigate to patron detail page
3. Test **"üì∑ Take Photo"**:
   - Should open camera app or in-browser camera
   - On iOS: May open camera app directly
   - On Android: May show in-browser camera interface
4. Test **"üìÅ Choose File"**:
   - Should open gallery/file picker

### Expected Behavior:

#### Camera Access Scenarios:

- ‚úÖ **Permission Granted**: Shows camera modal with live video feed
- ‚ùå **Permission Denied**: Shows error message, falls back to file picker
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Camera Available**: Automatically uses file picker

#### Upload Process:

1. Select/capture image
2. Cropping modal appears with preview
3. Click "Upload Photo"
4. Image uploads to Cloudinary
5. Avatar updates immediately
6. Success feedback shown

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working:

- **Check browser permissions**: Ensure camera access is allowed
- **HTTPS Required**: Camera API only works on HTTPS (or localhost)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers required (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### File Upload Issues:

- **File Size**: Max 5MB limit
- **File Type**: Only image files accepted (jpg, png, gif, etc.)
- **Network**: Check internet connection for Cloudinary upload

### Mobile-Specific:

- **iOS Safari**: May redirect to camera app instead of in-browser camera
- **Android Chrome**: Usually shows in-browser camera interface
- **Permissions**: User must grant camera/file access permissions

## Technical Details

### Camera API Features:

- Uses `getUserMedia()` API for camera access
- Supports both front (`facingMode: 'user'`) and back (`facingMode: 'environment'`) cameras
- Graceful fallback to file input if camera fails

### Image Processing:

- Client-side cropping using HTML5 Canvas
- Automatic square crop from center of image
- Base64 encoding for upload to API
- Server-side upload to Cloudinary

### Browser Compatibility:

- ‚úÖ Chrome 53+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 36+
- ‚úÖ Safari 11+
- ‚úÖ Edge 12+
- ‚ùå Internet Explorer (not supported)

## Security Notes

- Camera access requires user permission
- HTTPS required for camera API in production
- Images uploaded to secure Cloudinary storage
- File type and size validation on both client and server
